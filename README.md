# Donna Lee - Portfolio

## Description

This challenge required me to create a portfolio that will showcase my skills and talents to potential employers. No starter code was provided, and therefore, the portfolio was built from scratch using all knowledge obtained from my previous classes in HTML and CSS. I reviewed the acceptance criteria to ensure all criteria was met, and this portfolio will continuously be updated as I build my experience during the coding bootcamp.

## Installation

My responsibility was to satisfy the acceptance criteria, create a new repository on GitHub, commit and push any changes to the repository, and deploy to GitHub Pages to view the website live. The HTML code is available on index.html, and the CSS code is available on style.css in the assets folder. 

## Usage

The portfolio will be deployed after ensuring all criteria was met. When you click the items on the navigation bar, the page will move to the appropriate section.

The About Me section summarizes my life and experiences to potential employers. 

The Work section showcases my work, and the first work experience (application) is larger in size than the others. When clicking the images of the applications, you will be taken to placeholder images that will be used temporarily until I build my experience, and future completed projects will be able to replace the placeholder images. 

The Contact section allows potential employers to contact me via email and phone as well as review my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
